Your typography is now updated to a thick, serif, editorial, wide-spaced look across the homepage and hero section.

If you want me to:

convert the hero back into a fully functional 3-slide autoplay carousel,

add per-slide typography variations,

or switch to a high-fashion Vogue-style serif system,


just say “carousel version” and I’ll retrofit the entire file cleanly.
